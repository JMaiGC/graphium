**Added:**

* Add FLAG (Free Large-Scale Adversarial Augmentation on Graphs), a form of adversarial data augmentation to boost performance of GNNs across various molecular tasks. FLAG accomplishes this by iteratively augmenting node features with gradient-based adversarial perturbations during training. See the paper on `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09891>`_ and authors' code on `GitHub <https://github.com/devnkong/FLAG>`_ for more information.
